An alternative version of **RegexFind** addon based on overriding `nsIFind` XPCOM interface through Javascript.

The initial idea was taken from the old Firefox 3.5 addon **/Find Bar/** which previously existed on https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/find-bar/ with source code on http://hg.oxymoronical.com/extensions/FindBar/.
